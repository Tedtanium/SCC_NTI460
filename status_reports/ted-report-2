Student Name: Ted Jensen
Status Report #2
Date: 4/28/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

I have completed (as far as I know currently) the configuration of the Cisco switch that we will be using, alongside Cody. The script can be found on my Github and will actually be included in this pull request. Cody and I also pulled everyone together and created a processes list that we would accomplish together during today's meeting.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
A more regular documentation cycle, and plans for better change management standards amongst us.

What is getting in your way?
Mostly bikeshedding. We'll get to talking about what we need to do for the day as we meet up only to go back and talk about things unrelated to the tasks presented.
